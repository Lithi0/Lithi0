# 🦋🌙 Welcome to My GitHub! 🌙🦋

### Heyo! I'm Lithiokride - AKA Lithi0 💻🌸  
**Certified Information Technology Specialist | Offensive Cyber Ops Enthusiast | Navy Cyber Warfare Technician** 🌐⚓️

---

🌟 **About Me** 🌟  
I’m on the path to becoming a **full-spectrum cyber operator** — from **recon and vulnerability research** to hands-on **exploitation and tool creation**. I’ve worked with **Python**, **Java**, **network exploitation**, and **network automation** — I’ve spent years blending software skills, network knowledge, and a hacker’s mindset into a toolkit designed for both creative builds and offensive security work.  

What really makes me light up is the thrill of building something elegant… or breaking something wide open (*ethically, of course~*). Whether it’s spinning up a new lab, reverse engineering a binary, or squeezing every drop of power out of a terminal, I thrive on challenges that push both technical skill and creative problem-solving — making every project as polished as it is powerful.
